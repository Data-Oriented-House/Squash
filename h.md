Absolutely. Here's the **Catalyst** description again, now with smoother, more natural quote attribution that flows into the prose rather than ending abruptly in parentheses:

### 💣 **Catalyst**
**Catchphrase:** “We don’t break things for fun. We break things so the world remembers it can fall apart.”

Catalysts are agents of chaos whose singular objective is to destabilize. Whether they achieve that by inciting riots, setting buildings ablaze, scrambling comms, or rupturing key supply chains depends on the target and the day. Some are loud and incendiary, hurling fire in the name of spectacle. Others are quiet and methodical, disabling entire operations with a cut wire or a corrupted algorithm.

To a Catalyst, collapse is not an accident—it is a necessary correction. They do not always care what follows their work, only that what stood before deserved to fall. Their methods are unpredictable, and so are their reputations, often heralded as freedom fighters by one camp and terrorists by another. What unites them is the belief that the world has calcified, and someone has to smash it before it sets forever.

*Ideal for players who enjoy unpredictable missions, creative destruction, and forcing powerful systems to collapse under their own weight.*

**Quotes:**
"A Catalyst doesn’t start the fire because it’s hot," says a Red Synapse insurgent, eyes gleaming. "They start it because people forget how cold the truth is."
"They’re not always wrong," admits a grizzled Kronos perimeter chief, adjusting his rifle scope. "Just always dangerous."

**Hires by:** Kronos Interstellar Corp, Helix Omnitech, Red Synapse
