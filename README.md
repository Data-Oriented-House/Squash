Stew is a minimalistic data-oriented entity-component module. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the Roblox Studio game engine. It was designed to be small, efficient, non-restrictive, and easy to use. Just like this README. You can find the API documentation on [our website](https://solarscuffle-bot.github.io/Stew/).
