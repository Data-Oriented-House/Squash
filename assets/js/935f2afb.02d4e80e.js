We can represent 256^2 = 65536 possible values with 2 bytes, 256^3 = 16777216 possible values with 3 bytes, and so on. There are many ways to interpret these bytes depending on context which is the key to serialization. All serialization does is turn information into data, in this case datatype instances to buffers. If used smartly, less data can be used to represent the same information which is what Squash exploits as much as possible.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"What is Squash?","description":"Squash is a very large library that can efficiently and intelligently serialize and compress your data with little effort.
