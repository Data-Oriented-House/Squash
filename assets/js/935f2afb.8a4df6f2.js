This is equivalent to 8 bits, or 1 byte. Therefore, we can represent 256^2 = 65536 possible values with 2 characters, 256^3 = 16777216 possible values with 3 characters, and so on. There are many ways to interpret these bytes depending on context. Knowing how to interpret these bytes is the key to serialization.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"What Is SerDes?","description":"Serdes is a common abbreviation used for Serialization Deserialization.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"why":{"id":"why","title":"Why Squash?","description":"Squash has come into existence to solve a common problem many developers end up facing. Imagine you are making a custom character controller and need to send updates to the server multiple times a second. If you don\'t play your cards right, you could end up sending an intolerable amount of data over the network per player. This is bad because it takes a lot of bandwidth to send and recieve data over the network. Now imagine making a save / load system, depending on the amount of information you need to save and load, you can end up making the player wait a long time to save and load their data. This is bad because it reduces player retention rates, and lowers the overall quality of the player experience.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"}}}')}}]);
